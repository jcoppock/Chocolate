      - "&7Guild Leaders can claim chunks of land for the guild and its members to protect
           it from others who may want to claim the area for themselves. Guilds can create a
           Portal in their territory so members can easily get back home!"
      - "&7Guild Leaders just need to type &f/guild portal&7."
      - "&7Want to go solo? No problem! Simply create a Guild by yourself!
           One-man Guilds are not penalized, although they may require more grinding."

      - "&7Rather than typing commands to perform special actions, you'll be using &3Magic
      Scrolls &7that you can craft!"
      - "&7For example, there are &3Scrolls &7that let you teleport around the world, fight your
      enemies, and much more!"
      - "&7These &3Spell Scroll &7recipes can be viewed in your Recipe Book! &3Spell Scrolls
      &7can only be made in Arcane Tables, like the one next to me."
      - "Check the Enderchest behind me. There should be a &3Teleport Scroll &7to
